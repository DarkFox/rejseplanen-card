# rejseplanen-card
Lovelace card for listing departures from Rejseplanen sensors

This works with the [Rejseplanen sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/rejseplanen/) included in Home Assistant.

I've tried to add as many styles for different transit types and routes as I could find, but please let me know if any are missing.
